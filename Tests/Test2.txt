Lyrics by Vladimir Maiakovsky

Please Listen!
If stars are lit,
it is something
that somebody needs?
Someone wants them
To be and to last,
Even calls them pearls, those specs of spit.
And suffocating
In the blizzards of midday dust,
He bursts in on God,
   afraid it's too late to start.
He cries,
kisses God's wiry hand,
begs
that there should certainly be a star,
swears
he won't survive
this starless torture with no end.

Afterwards he walks around
alarmed but calm
in appearance,
Asks, " Are you all right,
   there is nothing to fear so far?"
Please, listen!
If stars are lit,
it is something that somebody needs.
'Cause for someone it is so essential
that every evening above the roofs
there should be lit at least
one star.
                1914
